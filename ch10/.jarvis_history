              case chs of
              let chs = delta $ head $ choices resp
            if not (null (choices resp)) then do
          Just resp -> do
          Nothing -> return acc
        case jsonObject of
        let jsonObject = decode (BL.pack x) :: Maybe OpenAIResponse
    ( \acc x -> do

processResp ch = do
can you optimize this haskell code: processResp :: BS.ByteString -> IO (String, Usage)
